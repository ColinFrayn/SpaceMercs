- This project may not be distributed without acknowledgement.
- Not for commercial use.
- Most of the 2D artwork in this project is taken from public repositories. Anyone attempting to profit from or redistribute this work would be required to individually recognise all such contributions.
- The splash screen was generated using ChatGPT.
- Sound effects mostly taken from public archives and manipulated locally (shortened, clipped, merged) using Audacity.
- Yes, I know this code is weirdly designed. I have no idea how to write a game, I just like designing them.
- If you want to take this design and rewrite it properly, usign proper artists, sound engineers and game engineers, then please discuss with me first.
