- Over time you will recruit new members of your team with different skills and abilities.
- You will research new techologies, build, discover or buy new and mroe powerful weapons and armour.
- You will outfit your ship with increasingly powerful technologies, and trade it in for more powerful ships as your mercenary pay increases.
- You will gain levels as you run missions, and increase your key skills in combat and non-combat roles.
- You will eventually leave your home system and explore the local sector, eventually moving outwards to more distant sectors where other alien races reside.
- Over time you will run missions for the alien races, befrien them and gain even more powerful tehnologies.
- Eventually you will move out to more distant sectors where increasingly powerful enemies reside.
- In the most distant reaches of the galaxy you will search out and explore remains of powerful alien precursor races, and take their technology for your own.

# Notes

- This project may not be distributed without acknowledgement.
- Not for commercial use.
- Most of the 2D artwork in this project is taken from public repositories. Anyone attempting to profit from or redistribute this work would be required to individually recognise all such contributions.
  - Specifically much is taken from Patreon pages for :
    - OnlineTabletop (Jan Loos)
    - Techlanders
    - Caeora
- The splash screen was generated using ChatGPT because I suck at art. Obviously that would be replaced with custom art if this were ever released commercially.
- Sound effects mostly taken from public archives (Freesound, Soundbible) and manipulated locally (shortened, clipped, merged) using Audacity.
- Yes, I know this code is weirdly designed. I have no idea how to write a proper modern game, I just like designing them.
- If you want to take this design and rewrite it properly, using proper artists, sound engineers and game engineers, then please discuss with me first.
