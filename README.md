# Notes

- This project may not be distributed without acknowledgement.
- Not for commercial use.
- Most of the 2D artwork in this project is taken from public repositories. Anyoen attempting to profit from it would be required to individually recognise all such contributions.
- The splash screen was generated using ChatGPT.
- Sound effects mostly taken from public archives and manipulated locally (shortened, clipped, merged) using Audacity.
- Yes, I know this is weirdly designed. I have no idea how to write a game, I just like designing them.
