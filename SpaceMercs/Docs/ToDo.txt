ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

Test run Precursor mission (& keeping the core)
- Precursor: Test level type/size/sparseness changes at lower levels

At relations >= 3 maybe join human hypergates up to alien ones??
- Add a trade route between their two nearest colonies

Backburner : Features
-------------------------------------------------

Free movement/actions (don't consider Stamina) if there are no (alerted) enemies (& hide Next Turn button, attack) ??
- Soldier shields could recharge, but really only makes sense if free movement is done. Slow recharge every turn, or fully after battles.
- Don't do this for timed missions

Enemies should use grenades / grenade weapons / emitter weapons properly

Generate more legendary missions continuously somehow. Maybe Space Hulks regenerate??

Any boss creature must be able to get to the entrance?? Or at least cover a sizeable number of squares

What should attack skill do for an AoE weapon (grenade or cone), if anything?

Redo NewGame dialog in-window?

DragDrop: Should be able to (CTRL+drag) in EquipmentView / TeamView to move an entire stack Floor<->Inventory or ShipStores<->Inventory.

Add overwatch ability to soldiers (not heavies or snipers)

Add in ricochet ShotType (e.g. Disc Thrower) that bounces off walls??

Make explosion different colours specified by the item (e.g. grenade) in MissionLevel.KillCreature and also VisualEffect.ResolveEffect

Do alien colonies need names?

Cover
- When partially hidden from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Including large creatures

Improve Soldier textures:
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
- Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
-- Change texture based on race
-- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Improve the Encumbrance icon : Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails()


-------------------------------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------------------------------

Remove as many Windows MessageBoxes as possible (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border. Optimise?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Write/update documentation
