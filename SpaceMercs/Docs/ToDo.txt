-------------------------------------------------
ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

Remove all warnings and messages

Testing

MapViewMission
- VisualEffect.DisplayShotLine()
- Test handling of large creatures

Display star labels & flags on map


==========================================================================================================


-----------------------
Done Since Last Release
-----------------------

Updated all grapics to OpenGL4

Updated text renderer to use TrueType fonts

Prevented targetting of self or own team in missions


-------
Testing
-------

Encounters : Are there too many of them? Test in lots of situations.

System view : Star sometimes vanishes on certain aspect ratios; planets overlap;

Got a crash doing ship battle and disposing something
- Similar after ship mission, returning to system view (Test Encounter End). Not easy to replicate.

Check all MenuItem.Enabled/Disabled correctly


---------------------
Backburner : Features
---------------------

First Contact
- Encounter a stranded/hostile vessel of a new alien race
- Encounter creatures in a scanner mission e.g. "Ursalon Bandits"
-- Maybe display in mission details as "Unknown Bandits"
- Arriving at a planet with a colony of that race
- If ship is alien but you haven't met that alien race then handle it differently
-- Display as unknown

Need to do missions to gain favour with alien races first
- Need a baseline rep before you can trade
- Higher rep = better prices

Check what happens when we found colonies in systems owned by other races (should worsen race relations and warn before)

Add new trade routes automatically over time?
- Connect based on size of colonies in systems and their separation

Better soldier textures
- Change texture based on race
- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Bonus damage on weapons? Framework for this exists, but nothing adds bonus damage

More things that need Sound Effects (Sounds from http://soundbible.com/)
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?

ShipView: Show ship shields
- Display ellipse, blended, before drawing the rooms (but after starfield)
- Vary transparency based on shield strength

Name planets/systems based on what the owning race's language sounds like

Travel / ShipCombat:
- Ships should move around a bit
- Check if regen works (auto repair, regen plating)

Research Functionality
- Research higher tier weapons & armour ; Research bionics
-- Rely on the appropriate skills
-- How does this work?
- Add a button for it?

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Add bionic implants? Salvageable from dead humanoids of higher level or manufactured in Medlab? Too complex?

Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each creature

Add light sources for max. vision range? 

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Handle defeat:
- ScanPlanet.RunMission -> Defeat
- ColonyView.RunMission -> Defeat
- Not necessarily dead, provided there's at least one soldier left in the current ship...
- MapView.GameOver()

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Encumbrance icon : Make it better

Travel.DrawBattle() : Convert Frag to a vertex array for optimisation

DrawShipHoverInfo() : Add multi-line info for equipment?

Improve TextRenderer
- Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Encounter.cs : Remove MessageBox and replace with in-game messages
- InactiveEncounter
- ActiveEncounter

Profile everything, especially AI

Add graphics for more creature types
- Or replace them with textures?

MissionLevel.DisplayEntities : Concurrent access to Entities caused crash. Have wrapped in RO list to avoid this. Monitor stability.

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Monitor savegame file size and reduce if necessary
- Utils.RunLengthEncode(string str)
- Utils.RunLengthDecode(string str)
- Zip it up (gives 8-9x but makes it unreadable)
