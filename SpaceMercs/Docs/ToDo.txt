ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

Melee defence/att - subtract encumbrance * 2 at least

Periodic dmg : Only make sound for first hit then push through and subsequent ticks more rapidly

heavy weapon def penalty in melee

Display stamina tooltip on TeamView and EquipmentView (Recharge, contributions)

Test run SpaceHulk mission (& keeping the core)
Test run Precursor mission (& keeping the core)

Precursor/SpaceHulk missions
- Precursor: Test level type/size/sparseness changes at lower levels
- Vary CreatureGroups at lower levels
- What is the primary enemy of the Precursors? Add them in, especially at lower levels
- Return Cores to Homeworlds for additional +relations. Where?

Display when a weapon is recharging

Why shouldn't everyone get power armour & heavy weapons? What is the disadvantage?

Making Epic weapons takes a space hulk core. Legendary weapons requires a Precursor core?? Maybe?

Any boss creature must be able to get to the entrance?? Or at least cover a sizeable number of squares

What should attack skill do for an AoE weapon (grenade or cone)?

Soldier shields do not recharge. Should they? Would it lead to wasting loads of time outside battles??

Free movement/actions (don't consider Stamina) if there are no (alerted) enemies (& hide Next Turn button, attack) ??

Race relations degrade over time? Or tend towards their base level?

Ship Inventory selection / transfer is very annoying - scroll down, select, skip

Large hulk missions (many levels) in second ring and outer

Alien solar systems:
- Alien colonies need names
- Alien systems need names

Add in ricochet ShotType (e.g. Disc Thrower) that bounces off walls

Make explosion different colours specified by the item (e.g. grenade) in MissionLevel.KillCreature and also VisualEffect.ResolveEffect

New Item Ideas:
- Elithiri: Personal teleporter? Can move within sight line up to X squares. Use like grenade weapon.
- Grey? Life scanner (shows blips for any unseen creatures within a range. Passive or active? Maybe an active scan area like a grenade)

Cover
- When partially hidden from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Including large creatures

Improve Creature textures:
- Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
-- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?
- Add graphics for more creature types
-- Or replace them with textures?
- Better soldier textures
-- Change texture based on race
-- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Add overwatch ability to soldiers (not heavies or snipers)

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Improve the Encumbrance icon


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")
- All but one are blocking Yes/No decision boxes

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Write/update documentation
