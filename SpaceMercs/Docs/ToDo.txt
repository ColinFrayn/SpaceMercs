ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

Test run Precursor mission (& keeping the core)
- Precursor: Test level type/size/sparseness changes at lower levels

Pay to reset UtilitySkill choices somehow. Maybe per point?

Shredding ammo

Add creature textures using bitmaps

DragDrop: Should be able to select single (SHIFT+drag) or multiple (CTRL+drag) in EquipmentView / TeamView

==================================================================================================================


-------------------------------------------------
Backburner : Features
-------------------------------------------------

Generate more legendary missions continuously somehow. Maybe Space Hulks regenerate??

Display somewhere when a weapon is recharging

Any boss creature must be able to get to the entrance?? Or at least cover a sizeable number of squares

What should attack skill do for an AoE weapon (grenade or cone), if anything?

Free movement/actions (don't consider Stamina) if there are no (alerted) enemies (& hide Next Turn button, attack) ??
- Soldier shields could recharge, but really only makes sense if free movement is done. Slow recharge every turn, or fully after battles.

Redo NewGame dialog in-window?

Add overwatch ability to soldiers (not heavies or snipers)

Alien solar systems:
- Alien colonies need names
- Alien systems need names

Add in ricochet ShotType (e.g. Disc Thrower) that bounces off walls

Make explosion different colours specified by the item (e.g. grenade) in MissionLevel.KillCreature and also VisualEffect.ResolveEffect

Cover
- When partially hidden from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Including large creatures

Improve Entity textures:
- Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
-- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
- Better soldier textures
-- Change texture based on race
-- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Improve the Encumbrance icon

Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border. Optimise?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Write/update documentation
