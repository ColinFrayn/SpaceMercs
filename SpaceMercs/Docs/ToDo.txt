Show dmg at different xPos when doing multiple so they don't overlap

==========================================================================================================

Backburner : Features
---------------------

What should attack roll for a AoE weapon like grenade launcher of flame thrower do? Maybe add in perturbation to target??

How do we lose favour with races? Why would we want to? Maybe over time??
- Colonising one of "their" systems?
-- Is it possible to disband a colony once created?

Make explosion different colours specified by the item (e.g. grenade) in MissionLevel.KillCreature and also VisualEffect.ResolveEffect

Cover
- When partially hidden from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Large creatures should be easier to hit (they are currently), but reduce that when they are partially covered.

Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?

Add overwatch?

Add more alien-only items
- Life scanner (shows blips for any unseen creatures within a range. Passive or active?) [Greys]

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Better soldier textures
- Change texture based on race
- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects (Sounds from http://soundbible.com/)
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Add graphics for more creature types
- Or replace them with textures?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Encumbrance icon : Make it better


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")
- All but one are blocking Yes/No decision boxes

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Name planets/systems based on what the owning race's language sounds like??

Write/update documentation
