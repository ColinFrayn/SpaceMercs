ToDo List

Bug: Descended to next mission level - random bit of map was visible (shaded) that shouldn't have been. Repro??

==========================================================================================================


---------------------
Backburner : Features
---------------------

Travel.RunBattle(): Ships should move around a bit up and down or maybe backwards, rotate etc.? 

First Contact
- Encounter a stranded/hostile vessel of a new alien race
-- Loads of places where Race.Name is used. If Race is not known then replace with "Unidentified"
- Encounter creatures in a scanner mission e.g. "Ursalon Bandits"
-- Maybe display in mission details as "Unknown Bandits"
- Arriving at a planet with a colony of that race
- If ship is alien but you haven't met that alien race then handle it differently
-- Display as unknown

MapViewMission - VisualEffect.DisplayShotLine()

Need to do missions to gain favour with alien races first
- Need a baseline rep before you can trade
- Higher rep = better prices

Check what happens when we found colonies in systems owned by other races (should worsen race relations and warn before)

Add new trade routes automatically over time?
- Connect based on size of colonies in systems and their separation
- What do trade routes accomplish? Maybe make certain colony types > 1 possible? Improve stock? Improve prices based on connectivity?

Better soldier textures
- Change texture based on race
- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Bonus damage on weapons? Framework for this exists, but nothing actually adds bonus damage

More things that need Sound Effects (Sounds from http://soundbible.com/)
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?

ShipView: Show ship shields
- Display ellipse, blended, before drawing the rooms (but after starfield)
- Vary transparency based on shield strength

Research Functionality
- Research higher tier weapons & armour ; Research bionics
-- Rely on the appropriate skills
-- How does this work?
- Add a button for it?

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Add bionic implants? Salvageable from dead humanoids of higher level or manufactured in Medlab? Too complex?

Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?

Add light sources for max. vision range? 

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Add graphics for more creature types
- Or replace them with textures?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Encumbrance icon : Make it better

Improve colony icon on System View


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")

DrawShipHoverInfo() : Add multi-line info for equipment?

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Monitor savegame file size and reduce if necessary
- Utils.RunLengthEncode(string str)
- Utils.RunLengthDecode(string str)
- Zip it up (gives 8-9x but makes it unreadable)

Name planets/systems based on what the owning race's language sounds like??
