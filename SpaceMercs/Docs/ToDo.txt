ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

** MapViewGUI.OpenScanPlanetDialog() : Is it's a SpaceHulk then HAO == null

Display when a weapon is recharging somehow

Stats: (Use MessageWindow??)
- Display Kill count per soldier and Strongest enemy killed
- Highest difficulty mission completed [TRACK]
- Race relations (if known)
- Number of Precursor Cores gathered, and most valuable [TRACK] (display only if >0)
- Number of SpaceHulk Cores, and most valuable [TRACK] (display only if >0)

PrecursorCore, SpaceHulkCore
-- First city levels more sparse; Upper levels smaller? (Bottom-most level huge)
- Keep track of the number & level gathered
- Return to Homeworld or other race Homeworld for additional +relations. (HOW?)
-- Or sell for cash
- Maybe add extra missions e.g. Artifact, Assassination (core mission is the hardest)
- What is the primary enemy of the Precursors?

Start race relations off lower
- Colony screens should be disabled if race relations too low. Missions are always there.

Experiment moving human colonies & trade routes out into second ring

Backburner : Features
---------------------

Making Epic weapons takes a space hulk core. Legendary weapons requires a Precursor core?

Any boss creature must be able to get to the entrance?? Or at least cover a sizeable number of squares

What should attack skill do for an AoE weapon (grenade or cone)?

Free movement/actions (don't consider Stamina) if there are no (alerted) enemies (& hide Next Turn button, attack) ??

Race relations degrade over time? Or tend towards their base level?

Ship Inventory selection / transfer is very annoying - scroll down, select, skip

Large hulk missions (many levels) in second ring and outer

Alien solar systems:
- Alien colonies need names
- Alien systems need names

Add in ricochet ShotType (e.g. Disc Thrower) that bounces off walls

Make explosion different colours specified by the item (e.g. grenade) in MissionLevel.KillCreature and also VisualEffect.ResolveEffect

New Item Ideas:
- Elithiri: Personal teleporter? Can move within sight line up to X squares. Use like grenade weapon.
- Grey? Life scanner (shows blips for any unseen creatures within a range. Passive or active? Maybe an active scan area like a grenade)

Cover
- When partially hidden from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Including large creatures

Improve Creature textures:
- Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
-- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?
- Add graphics for more creature types
-- Or replace them with textures?
- Better soldier textures
-- Change texture based on race
-- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Add overwatch ability to soldiers

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Improve the Encumbrance icon


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")
- All but one are blocking Yes/No decision boxes

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Write/update documentation
