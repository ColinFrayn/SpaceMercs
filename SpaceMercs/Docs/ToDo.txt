ToDo List

MapViewShip
- DrawShipHoverInfo()
-- Add multi-line info for equipment

Travel
- Travel.Display()
- Don't run it off the periodic timer, run it off the built-in update tick
- Turn it off when saving
- Make sure it restarts when loading

Disable Colony button when travelling

Ship.DrawBattle()

Main Menu
  Mission -> (Checkboxes) Labels, HealthBars, TravelDistance, MovementPath, ViewEffects, ViewDetectionRadii, Details

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes

System view
- Star sometimes vanishes on certain aspect ratios

Improve TextRenderer
- Bold, Shadow, Border

First Contact
- Encounter a stranded/hostile vessel of a new alien race
- Encounter creatures in a scanner mission e.g. "Ursalon Bandits"
-- Maybe display in mission details as "Unknown Bandits"
- Arriving at a planet with a colony of that race
- If ship is alien but you haven't met that alien race then handle it differently
-- Display as unknown

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Add graphics for more creature types
- Or replace them with textures?

MissionLevel.DisplayEntities : Concurrent access to Entities caused crash. Have wrapped in RO list to avoid this. Monitor stability.

Need to do missions to gain favour with alien races first
- Need a baseline rep before you can trade
- Higher rep = better prices

Check what happens when we found colonies in systems owned by other races (should worsen race relations and warn before)

Add new trade routes automatically over time?
- Connect based on size of colonies in systems and their separation

Better soldier textures
- Change texture based on race
- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Bonus damage on weapons? Framework for this exists, but nothing adds bonus damage

More things that need Sound Effects (Sounds from http://soundbible.com/)
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?

ShipView: Show ship shields
- Display ellipse, blended, before drawing the rooms (but after starfield)
- Vary transparency based on shield strength

Name planets/systems based on what the owning race's language sounds like

Travel / ShipCombat:
- Ships should move around a bit
- Check if regen works (auto repair, regen plating)

Change message boxes to be a graphical popup inside the main window (and pass through a "ReportMessage" Action<string> to all function calls)

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Research Functionality
- Research higher tier weapons & armour ; Research bionics
-- Rely on the appropriate skills
-- How does this work?
- Add a button for it?

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Add bionic implants? Salvageable from dead humanoids of higher level or manufactured in Medlab? Too complex?

Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each creature

Add light sources for max. vision range? 

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Monitor savegame file size and reduce if necessary
- Utils.RunLengthEncode(string str)
- Utils.RunLengthDecode(string str)
- Zip it up (gives 8-9x but makes it unreadable)

Handle defeat:
- ScanPlanet.RunMission -> Defeat
- ColonyView.RunMission -> Defeat
- Not necessarily dead, provided there's at least one soldier left in the current ship...
- MapView.GameOver()

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?
