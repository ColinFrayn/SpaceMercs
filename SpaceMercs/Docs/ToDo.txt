ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

What to do when we get stuck somewhere and can't travel because of the risk of interception (especially with an underpowered ship)
- Maybe make interstellar travel not prone to interception?
- Allow indirect routes that take longer but reduce interception risk?
- Pay for escort (if starting at a colony with a high enough rep)?

Test run Precursor mission (& keeping the core)
- Precursor: Test level type/size/sparseness changes at lower levels

==================================================================================================================

Backburner : Features
-------------------------------------------------

Any boss creature must be able to get to the entrance?? Or at least cover a sizeable number of squares
- Maybe pick 20 squares and see what fraction can be reached (if size > 1)??

Add unique skills with weapon skill increments (every 5 levels?) e.g. charge/whirlwind for melee, crippling shot for sniper, shredding shot for assault, etc.
- Maybe add a talent point every 3 levels, allow selection based on what weapon skills you possess.
- Talents can be basic, elite, master for extra bonuses.
- Possibly add a new tab next to weapon/utility skills

Cover
- When partially hidden from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Including large creatures

At relations >= 3 allow player to join human hypergates up to alien ones??
- Buy an item to link routes; choose nearby system; apply to alien gate if permissioned?? Hyperspace Bridge (costs a fortune)
- Links are impassable if relations drop with alien. Check this when travelling.
- Pathing through an alien civ costs differently based on the alien civ relations
- Just to check, make sure that cost for home civ changes based on relations with Human Race.
- Display bridges differently. Maybe double line?? Or bicolour line. needs to be thicker maybe?

What should attack skill do for an AoE weapon (grenade or cone), other than increase dmg? Nothing?

?? Free movement/actions (don't consider Stamina) if there are no (alerted) enemies (& hide Next Turn button, attack) ??
- Soldier shields could recharge, but really only makes sense if free movement is done. Slow recharge every turn, or fully after battles.
- Don't do this for timed missions

Enemies should use grenades / grenade weapons / emitter weapons properly

Generate more legendary missions continuously somehow. Maybe Space Hulks regenerate??

Redo NewGame dialog in-window?

DragDrop: Should be able to (CTRL+drag) in EquipmentView / TeamView to move an entire stack Floor<->Inventory or ShipStores<->Inventory.

Add overwatch ability to soldiers (not heavies or snipers)

Add in ricochet ShotType (e.g. Disc Thrower) that bounces off walls??

Make explosion different colours specified by the item (e.g. grenade) in MissionLevel.KillCreature and also VisualEffect.ResolveEffect

Do alien colonies need names?

Improve Soldier textures:
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
- Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
-- Change texture based on race
-- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Improve the Encumbrance icon : Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails()


-------------------------------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------------------------------

Remove as many Windows MessageBoxes as possible

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border. Optimise?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Write/update documentation
