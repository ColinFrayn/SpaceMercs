ToDo List

Backburner : Features
-------------------------------------------------

Generate more legendary missions continuously somehow. Maybe Space Hulks regenerate??

Display somewhere when a weapon is recharging

Why shouldn't everyone get power armour & heavy weapons? What is the disadvantage?
- Encumbrance now has quiet a few drawbacks; cost; bad in melee; Only one shot; 

Any boss creature must be able to get to the entrance?? Or at least cover a sizeable number of squares

What should attack skill do for an AoE weapon (grenade or cone), if anything?

Free movement/actions (don't consider Stamina) if there are no (alerted) enemies (& hide Next Turn button, attack) ??
- Soldier shields could recharge, but really only makes sense if free movement is done. Slow recharge every turn, or fully after battles.

Race relations degrade over time? Or tend towards their base level?

Ship Inventory selection / transfer is very annoying - scroll down, select, skip

Alien solar systems:
- Alien colonies need names
- Alien systems need names

Add in ricochet ShotType (e.g. Disc Thrower) that bounces off walls

Make explosion different colours specified by the item (e.g. grenade) in MissionLevel.KillCreature and also VisualEffect.ResolveEffect

Cover
- When partially hidden from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Including large creatures

Improve Creature textures:
- Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
-- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?
- Add graphics for more creature types
-- Or replace them with textures?
- Better soldier textures
-- Change texture based on race
-- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Add overwatch ability to soldiers (not heavies or snipers)

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Improve the Encumbrance icon


-------------------------------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")
- All but one are blocking Yes/No decision boxes

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Write/update documentation
