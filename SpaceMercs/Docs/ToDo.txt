-------------------------------------------------
ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

Research Dialog (maybe copy Gate??)
- Create a research dialog in the ship view screen
-- Show everything manageable at current level of Relations, character level, nPop, nSys, facilities available
--- Greyed out if other requirements not met (Cash cost and materials)
-- Research takes time, cost, materials.
-- Success chance related to player skill levels compared to requirements

Materials also should have Requirements? Currently they require CivSize
- How to deal with them?
  foreach (MaterialType mat in StaticData.Materials) {
      if (mat.CivSize > humanPop && mat.CivSize <= newHumanPop) newTech.Add($"Material: {mat.Name}");
  }

Backburner : Features
---------------------

Level up (post mission) -> new research available announcement? in MapView(Mission).CeaseMission ??

Ranged weapons for e.g. shadow beasts, void beasts (such as psychic weapons, void lance, ... ?)

How do we lose favour with races? Why would we want to? Maybe over time??
- Colonising one of "their" systems?

How to make slime creatures more dangerous? Maybe have them split?

Cover
- When covered from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Large creatures should be easier to hit (they are currently), but reduce that when they are partially covered.

Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?

Add overwatch?

Add more alien-only items
- Life scanner (shows blips for any unseen creatures within a range. Passive or active?) [Greys]

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

MapViewMission - VisualEffect.DisplayShotLine() ??

Anything more we can do to compress the save game file? Maybe store only AOs that are not as generated?

Better soldier textures
- Change texture based on race
- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

More things that need Sound Effects (Sounds from http://soundbible.com/)
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

Is Civ expansion too fast? Reduce expansion rate as Civ gets larger, or else it will be exponential??
- Make moon colonies smaller??
- Prevent civ from building colonies itself - only allow Team to make them??

CivSize gating: Is this the wrong way to do it? Easy to game it by just flying around a lot with a NLS drive...

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Add graphics for more creature types
- Or replace them with textures?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Encumbrance icon : Make it better


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Name planets/systems based on what the owning race's language sounds like??

Update documentation
