ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

Check auto-building of trade routes

==========================================================================================================


---------------------
Backburner : Features
---------------------

Add overwatch?

Maybe add in an Invasion mission type (More creatures get added in waves. Have to survive X waves.)

Maybe add in weapon mods like elemental damage, extra range, sight, silencer?
- Silencer affects calculation in UpdateDetectionForLocation() and reduces volume of sound played?

Add more alien-only items
- Life scanner (shows blips for any unseen creatures within a range. Passive or active?) [Greys]
- Some kind of shotgun? [Ogrish]

Travel.RunBattle(): Ships should move around a bit up and down or maybe backwards, rotate etc.? 

Cover
- When covered from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Large creatures should be easier to hit (they are currently), but reduce that when they are partially covered.

First Contact
- Encounter a stranded/hostile vessel of a new alien race
-- Loads of places where Race.Name is used. If Race is not known then replace with "Unidentified"
- Encounter creatures in a scanner mission e.g. "Ursalon Bandits"
-- Maybe display in mission details as "Unknown Bandits"
- Arriving at a planet with a colony of that race
- If ship is alien but you haven't met that alien race then handle it differently
-- Display as unknown

Anything more we can do to compress the save game file? Maybe store only AOs that are not as generated?

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions? 

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

MapViewMission - VisualEffect.DisplayShotLine() ??

Better soldier textures
- Change texture based on race
- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

More things that need Sound Effects (Sounds from http://soundbible.com/)
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?

ShipView: Show ship shields in combat
- Display ellipse, blended, before drawing the rooms (but after starfield)
- Vary transparency based on shield strength

Research Functionality
- Research higher tier weapons & armour ; Research bionics?
-- Rely on the appropriate skills
-- How does this work?
-- Add bionic implants? Salvageable from dead humanoids of higher level or manufactured in Medlab? Too complex?
- Add a button for it?

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Add graphics for more creature types
- Or replace them with textures?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Encumbrance icon : Make it better


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Monitor savegame file size and reduce if necessary
- Utils.RunLengthEncode(string str)
- Utils.RunLengthDecode(string str)
- Zip it up (gives 8-9x but makes it unreadable)

Name planets/systems based on what the owning race's language sounds like??

Update documentation
