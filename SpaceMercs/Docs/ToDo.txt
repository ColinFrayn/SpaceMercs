-------------------------------------------------
ToDo List
-------------------------------------------------

Check auto-building of trade routes

Check gaining rep with aliens + gaining a level

==========================================================================================================


---------------------
Backburner : Features
---------------------

Add overwatch?

Maybe add in weapon mods like elemental damage, extra range, sight, silencer?
- Silencer affects calculation in UpdateDetectionForLocation() and reduces volume of sound played?

Add more alien-only items
- Life scanner (shows blips for any unseen creatures within a range. Passive or active?) [Greys]

How do we lose favour with races? Why would we want to?

Travel.RunBattle(): Ships should move around a bit up and down or maybe backwards, rotate etc.? 

Cover
- When covered from the attacker, get a def bonus
- Large creatures should be easier to hit (they are currently), but reduce that when they are partially covered.

Anything more we can do to compress the save game file? Maybe store only AOs that are not as generated?

Add light sources for max. vision range on missions??

Allow creatures to enter stealth
- Allow searching for them (modifying chance by the creature level or stealth score)

MapViewMission - VisualEffect.DisplayShotLine() ??

Better soldier textures
- Change texture based on race
- Change texture based on equipment / weapons

More things that need Sound Effects (Sounds from http://soundbible.com/)
- Pick up all
- Scavenge (All or single)
- Hover on buttons in GUI?
- Soldier death
- Walking?
- Ship combat

ShipView: Show ship shields in combat
- Display ellipse, blended, before drawing the rooms (but after starfield)
- Vary transparency based on shield strength

Research Functionality
- Research higher tier weapons & armour ; Research bionics?
-- Rely on the appropriate skills
-- How does this work?
-- Add bionic implants? Salvageable from dead humanoids of higher level or manufactured in Medlab? Too complex?
- Add a button for it?

Add locked doors in dungeon maps?

Display visual effect on creatures if they have shields
- Textures.GenerateCreatureTexture()  (all types)
-- Need to make textures specifically for each individual creature?

Allow creatures to have multiple weapons (ranged and melee)?

Investigate Blockly for scripting soldiers?

Add graphics for more creature types
- Or replace them with textures?

Soldier.DisplaySoldierDetails() : Encumbrance icon : Make it better


-------------------------
Backburner : Improvements
-------------------------

Remove all Windows MessageBoxes  (tagged with  "// REPLACE WITH msgBox")

Improve TextRenderer: Add Bold, Shadow, Border

Displaying colonies of other races: Are they visually distinct?

Profile everything, especially AI

Could potentially get stuck with no doable missions, no money, unable to travel, unable to buy kit to travel. How to resolve it?

Name planets/systems based on what the owning race's language sounds like??

Update documentation
